# How does the lobby work?

# Record

You can select your game mode via the record. The record is in the hot bar in the 1 slot. When you have the
record in your hand, you can select the game mode with both mouse buttons.

# Profile

When you open your profile, you will find three pages where you can change your appearance, cosmetics and much more. In addition, you can manage your friends, switch welcome messages on and off, view bans and kicks and change your language.
