# How does the farm world work?
The main function of the farm world is to collect resources and food that you can then use on the citybuild server to construct buildings. In addition, you can also sell these materials for money.

# Insurance
In the farm world, you have the option to purchase various insurances from the insurance NPC at the spawn that will protect you against the loss of your inventory. There are several options to choose from, such as 1-hour, 2-hour, 5-hour, 10-hour, or 24-hour insurance, which you can purchase for a fee. If you lose your inventory despite the insurance, you can contact support to get a refund.
