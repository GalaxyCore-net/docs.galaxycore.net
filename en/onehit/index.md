OneHit is a game mode in which you can playfully earn coins on our server in multiplayer. The aim of the OneHit mode is to neutralise the opponent with a single sword or bow shot.

## Additional functions

During the game, you will be accompanied by customised messages and you will have the opportunity to purchase additional message packs. To enhance the game experience, you can also purchase a booster that quickly moves you away from your spawn position.
