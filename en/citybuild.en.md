# What is CityBuild?
In CityBuild you can build a small area (=a plot) of a large world with your friends. You can buy these plots with our in-game currency. You will learn how to do this on the following pages. You can access a universal menu with all sub-items, the PMenu, with */p*. Here you can also find all the commands in button form.



# Claiming a plot for yourself
There are two ways to claim a plot: *Automatic* and *Manual Assignment*.
For starters, automatic assignment is easier. With this you get a random, unoccupied plot. 
To get a plot via *automatic assignment*, use */p auto*.
The *manual assignment* works by standing on an unoccupied plot and using the */p claim* command. This is useful if you want to claim a plot next to your own or a friend's plot.
You can claim a maximum of 2 plots for free. Buy more via the PMenu!



# Basic functions
You can visit other players' plots with the command */p h* or */p v*.
You can reach important locations with the command */warp*.
You can view information about the plot you are standing on with */p i*. Here, if you have the necessary permissions, you can also make adjustments about the plot.
