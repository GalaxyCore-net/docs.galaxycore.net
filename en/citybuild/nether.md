# How does the Nether work?
The main function of the Nether is to collect resources and food that you can then use on the Citybuild server to construct buildings. In addition, you can also sell these materials for money.
The Nether resets every 24 hours, so you can always collect new resources.

# Insurance
As in the farm world, in the Nether you have the option to purchase various insurances from the insurance NPC at the spawn that will protect you against the loss of your inventory. There are several options to choose from, such as 1-hour, 2-hour, 5-hour, 10-hour, or 24-hour insurance, which you can purchase for a fee. If you lose your inventory despite the insurance, you can contact support to get a refund.
